# Oldagram

This was a Scrimba project. We were given the task of rendering a single post, in Instagram-form, from Vincent van Gogh using HTML and CSS. However, there was a stretch goal of iterating through an array and using JavaScript to render posts from van Gogh, Gustave Courbet and Joseph Ducreux. 

I completed the main task and then went on to complete the stretch goal as well as adding the ability to increment/decrement "likes" on a post by clicking the post's heart button (it turns red when "liked" and returns to its original color when unclicked). I also added the ability for visitors to add comments to a post.
